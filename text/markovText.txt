Due to the unfavorable influence of COVID last year, we have slowed down a little this year in our Honors Calculus BC class. We have had a lot of fruitful and insightful discussions in classes and all the students participate actively. Some of the homework problems are quite challenging but the students have worked hard to solve them successfully. I feel very fortunate to teach this group of talented and diligent students.

STUDENT has made a lot progress so far this year. This is a very challenging course but STUDENT has persisted to work hard.  He generally has very good knowledge of previous math concepts, but sometimes, he has some difficulty to apply newly acquired knowledge this year to solve current problems. So I suggest STUDENT review the relevant material when he finds any lapse in his understanding. I also encourage STUDENT to pay more attention to details to avoid careless mistakes and ask more questions in class whenever he is unclear about anything. I am confident that with his dedication and hard work STUDENT will have a very successful senior year at TBS.

STUDENT is doing well in the Honors Calculus BC class. He has actively participated in the classroom discussions and often volunteers to present his homework on the board, which contributes essentially to helping our class to become more student-centered and problem-based, key features of Harkness style. In the recent test on series, STUDENT made a few mistakes related to Maclaurin series. As we are moving to the final review for the AP exam in May, I recommend he begin by going over his previous homework and assessments and focus more on his weak areas. I am sure STUDENT will continue to work hard and achieve great success during the rest of the school year.

STUDENT has encountered some difficulty recently in the Advance Honors Math - Linear Algebra class. He has been able to complete his homework on time and participated in classroom discussions from time to time. We are moving to proof based problems this semester and STUDENT had a lot trouble completing his homework and did not do well on the assessments, partly due to the level of difficulty of the course content and partly due to his weaker math foundation. STUDENT's current grade is on the boundary of C+ and B- so I recommend him to go over the previous examples and homework problems carefully and try to mimic the key ideas and steps in his solutions in his future works. I also strongly encourage him to seek help and ask more questions whenever he feels the need. I am always available after school so it would help him more efficiently if he can talk to me on a one-to-one basis. I hope to see STUDENT's improved effort and better results during the rest of this semester.

STUDENT has made great progress in AP Calculus BC. He has always completed his assignments carefully and on time and got well-prepared for the class. He has also participated in the class discussion actively and can present his homework solutions from time to time. I encourage STUDENT to be more active in volunteering to present his work because it will not only help the small class to be more dynamic but also help him to better understand the material. STUDENT's performance is relatively steady throughout this semester except for the recent quiz on which he could not show much work when solving a problem on Riemann sums. Admittedly this is a very difficult topic and many students stumbled on it. But it is also one of the cornerstones of the integral calculus so that many later results depend crucially on it. Therefore I encourage STUDENT to put more effort in understanding this concept well as soon as possible. I will be available after school every day so I encourage STUDENT to meet me whenever he feels the needs. I am sure that with his perseverance and good work ethics STUDENT will achieve great success in his senior year at TBS.

STUDENT is making steady progress in our AP Calculus BC. He has completed his assignments on time and participated in classroom discussions actively. His recent test score dipped a little compared to his past assessments. I recommend STUDENT to go over the past tests and quizzes carefully and find out where his weakness is so that he can spend his time more efficiently. As we are moving to the final comprehensive review period to prepare for the AP exam in May I suggest that STUDENT can ask more questions whenever he is not sure of any concepts. I'm looking forward to meeting STUDENT in person in class after the spring break. With his dedication and good work ethics I am sure STUDENT will have a very successful senior year at TBS.
